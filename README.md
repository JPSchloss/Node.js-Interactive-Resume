Jonathan Schlosser's Version of STRML.net
=========

This code is based on Samuel Reed's work with [STRML.net](http://strml.net) but has been updated to show off Jonathan Schlosser's interactive resume. This was done as a fun project to start getting familiar with Node.js applications and interactive coding visualizations. Please enjoy!
